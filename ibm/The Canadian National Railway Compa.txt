Animals are a diverse group of organisms that inhabit every corner of the planet. From the microscopic tardigrades that can survive extreme conditions to the massive blue whales that roam the oceans, animals display a remarkable range of sizes, shapes, and behaviors. They are classified into various groups based on characteristics such as vertebrates (like mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish) and invertebrates (like insects, spiders, mollusks, and crustaceans). Animals play crucial roles in ecosystems as predators, prey, pollinators, and scavengers, contributing to the balance and health of their habitats. Human interaction with animals spans from companionship and domestication to scientific study and conservation efforts aimed at preserving species and their natural environments.
